It is usually used to solve the classic classification problem.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size = 3><strong>This lesson covers the following concepts of Logistics Regression:</strong></font>\n<br>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n\n<ol>\n    <li><a href=\"#ref1\">Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#ref2\">Utilizing Logistic Regression in TensorFlow</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#ref3\">Training</a></li>\n</ol>    \n</div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<a id=\"ref1\"></a>\n\n<h2>What is different between Linear and Logistic Regression?</h2>\n\nWhile Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class in which an observed data point belongs. In order to provide estimate for classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the <b>most probable class</b> for that data point. For this, we use <b>Logistic Regression</b>.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n<font size=\"3\"><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n<br>\n<br>\nLinear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, <i>y</i>, to some predictors (independent variables <i>x1</i>, <i>x2</i>, etc.). Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n<br><br>\n$$\ny = w0 + w1 \\times x1 + w2 \\times x2 + \\cdots\n$$\n<br>\nand finds the values of <i>w0</i>, <i>w1</i>, <i>w2</i>, etc. The term <i>w0</i> is the \"intercept\" or \"constant term\" (it's shown as <i>b</i> in the formula below):\n<br><br>\n$$\nY = W X + b\n$$\n<p></p>\n\n</div>\n\nLogistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, <i>y</i>, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n\nDespite the name logistic <i>regression</i>, it is actually a <b>probabilistic classification</b> model. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass = \\\\theta(y) = \\\\frac{e^y}{1 + e^y} = exp(y) / (1 + exp(y)) = p \n$$\n\nwhich produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity $-\\\\infty$) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity $+\\\\infty$). This now becomes a special kind of non-linear regression.\n\nIn this equation, <i>y</i> is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), <code>exp</code> is the exponential function and $\\\\theta(y)$ is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function\">logistic function</a>, also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve), and was first developed for modeling population growth.\n\nYou might also have seen this function before, in another configuration:\n\n$$\nProbabilityOfaClass = \\\\theta(y) = \\\\frac{1}{1+e^{-y}}\n$$\n\nSo, briefly, Logistic Regression passes the input through the logistic/sigmoid function but then treats the result as a probability:\n\n<img src=\"https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/kgv9alcghmjcv97op4d6onkyxevk23b1.png\" width=\"400\" align=\"center\">\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "* * *\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<a id=\"ref2\"></a>\n\n<h2>Utilizing Logistic Regression in TensorFlow</h2>\n\nWe begin by installing TensorFlow version 2.2.0 and its required prerequistes.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "!pip install grpcio==1.24.3\n!pip install tensorflow==2.2.0", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Restart kernel for latest version of TensorFlow to be activated**\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For us to utilize Logistic Regression in TensorFlow, we first need to import the required libraries.
